Priority:

Priority relates to how fast the bug or issue has to be fixed.
Priority is related to scheduling to resolve the problem.
Is largely related to business or marketing considerations in that it is indicatory of the importance of the bug especially in terms of stakeholders.
The priority status is also set based on the customer requirements.
Priority relates heavily to the technical aspect of the product and how ‘bad’ the impact of the bug is for the system.
Priority obviously dictates how urgently the issue should be fixed.
Fixes are carried out based also on the project’s priorities
The Priority status is set by the tester to the developer mentioning the time frame to fix a defect. If High priority is mentioned then the developer has to fix it at the earliest.
Severity:

Severity is related entirely to the quality standard.
Logically, severity enquires how severely the issue is affecting the functionality.
The severity type is defined by the tester based on the test cases and functionality.
Severity is assigned by tester according to the seriousness of the bug.
It is common to use four common categories of Severity:
The four common categories of Severity;
Show Stopper: 4 – Tester is unable to test application further.

Major Defect: 3 – Major functionality not working but able to continue testing the application.

Minor Defect: 2 – Bug in Functionality but in the sub module or one under the other

What is Sanity Testing?
Sanity Testing is a subset of Regression Testing which is performed to ensure that the code changes that are made are working properly.

Why Perform Sanity Testing?
The purpose of Sanity Testing is to determine that the changes in functionality and bug fixes are working as expected. It is also called as “Tester Acceptance Testing”

Cosmetic: 1 – Issues in location of object or ‘look and feel’ issue
